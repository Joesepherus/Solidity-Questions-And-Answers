<h2>What are Oracles?</h2>
<p>
Oracles can be used to deliver reliable data feeds from the outside world (also known as off-chain data) into smart contracts. They are used to either verify information or execute payments in smart contracts. You can see them as a smart contract’s “eyes and ears” so it can interact with the real world. This is particularly applicable to the Insurance & Payments industry.
