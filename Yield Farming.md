<h2>What is Yield Farming?</h2>
<p>
Yield farming is a strategy employed by cryptocurrency investors to maximise returns on their investments by using different DeFi protocols.
</p>
<p>
Yield farmers are always attempting to get the highest yield possible by frequently changing their strategies. The most profitable strategies usually involve at least a few DeFi protocols like Compound, Curve, Synthetix, Uniswap or Balancer. 
</p>
<p>
If the strategy doesn’t work anymore or if there is a better strategy available the yield farmers move their funds around. They may, for example, move the funds between different protocols or they may swap some of their cryptocurrency to others with a higher yield. In the yield farming world, this procedure is often referred to as crop rotation.
</p>
<p>
It’s much like people in traditional finance search for the best saving account with the highest APY. The acronym APY stands for annualised percentage yield, and it’s a common way to measure performance across different investments. It’s also a common way of expressing the returns of different yield farming strategies.

<h3>Liquidity Mining</h3>
<p>
Liquidity mining is a process of distributing tokens to protocol users as an incentive for adding liquidity. 
</p>
<h3>Leverage</h3>
<p>
In our yield farming world, farmers can deposit their cryptocurrency as collateral to one of the lending protocols and borrow other cryptocurrency. Now they can use the borrowed cryptocurrency as further collateral and borrow even more! By repeating the whole procedure farmers can leverage their initial capital a few times over and start generating even greater returns (or losses) on their initial capital.
</p>
<h3>Risk</h3>
<p>
Farmers are taking out loans that are overcollateralized, meaning if the (e.g. dollar) value of the collateral falls below a certain point, it can be liquidated.
</p>
<p>
Aside from the liquidation danger, we must consider our normal smart contract dangers such as flaws, platform upgrades, admin keys, and systemic risks, for example. In addition, we have a number of new attack vectors particular to DeFi, such as draining specific liquidity pools.
</p>
<p>
It’s worth remembering however that yield farming methods can become obsolete quickly, especially if protocol or incentive adjustments occur. Something that was previously profitable may no longer be so the next day, therefore it’s critical to keep an eye on running strategies and change crops if required.
