<h2>What is AAVE?</h2>
<p>
Aave is an open-source, non-custodial, and decentralised lending and borrowing platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. 
</p>
<p>
The protocol allows users to lend and borrow a wide range of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and tokens, in a trustless and transparent manner.
</p>
<p>
The way Aave works is that people deposit their money into a “liquidity pool.” From there, the protocol can use that money to give loans to other people. The loan can be paid back at any time by the borrower, along with the associated interest.
</p>
<p>
One of the key features of Aave is the requirement for borrowers to deposit collateral in order to borrow another asset. For example, a borrower may need to deposit 10 ETH in order to borrow 8 ETH worth of DAI. This is known as being overcollateralized, and the ratio of borrowed asset to deposited asset is called the Loan to Value (LTV) ratio, which is 80% in the above case.
</p>
<p>
The value of the collateral shouldn’t fall below a certain level w.r.t. the borrowed asset, say 105% of the value of the borrowed asset. This threshold is called the liquidation threshold.
</p>
<p>
Anyone (including you) can liquidate the asset. The liquidator needs to deposit the borrowed asset and receive the equivalent amount of collateral asset plus a bonus (say 5%) as a liquidation fee. Practically, liquidators usually install bots to beat the competition.
</p>
<p>
To avoid liquidation, you can increase your health factor by depositing more collateral assets or repaying part of your loan.
